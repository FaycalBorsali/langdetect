  Lugano Airport  is a regional airport in the Lugano area. It lies closer to the nearby village of Agno than to Lugano itself, and so is usually known as Lugano-Agno.Lugano-Agno's instrument approach procedure is quite challenging because of its steep angle of descent of 6.65°, more than double of the standard approach angle of 3°. This is due to its geographic location in the mouth of a valley.Lugano Airport is increasing its business jets operation, having solved the approach difficulties which arose during the past. Nowadays almost all kinds of mid- and long-range business jets (such as the Dassault Falcon 900-2000 and 7X, as well as Gulfstream series 2,3,4 and 5, and Cessna Citations of all types) are accepted and may perform a full legal landing in Lugano according to JAR OPS. Lugano Airport is aiming to become a leading regional business jet airport for the Ticino and Northern Italy regions by allowing passengers to avoid the difficulties of traffic congestion and waiting times at larger airports.Airlines and destinationsDarwin Airline (Berne, Dubrovnik, Geneva, Olbia, Rome-Fiumicino)Flybaboo (Geneva) More destinations from GenevaSwiss International Air LinesSwiss International Air Lines operated by Darwin Airline (Zurich)External linksLugano Airport &mdash; Official site Lugano Airport Qualification &mdash; Information for pilotsAero Club Lugano local flying Club informationGruppo Volo Motore Lugano &mdash; local flying ClubGoogle Earth KMZ &mdash; 3d model for use in Google EarthAvilù Flight Training Organisation FTO &mdash; local flying SchoolFotogallery of Lugano Airport &mdash; by Marco Pianca and Chris de Stefani - AirphototicinoP3 Flyers Ticino aerobatic team based at Lugano AirportCategory:Airports in Switzerland Category:Lugano Category:Ticino de:Flughafen Lugano-Agno es:Aeropuerto de Lugano fr:Aéroport international Lugano it:Aeroporto di Lugano-Agno nl:Luchthaven Lugano pl:Port lotniczy Lugano rm:Eroport Internaziunal da Lugano-Agno
