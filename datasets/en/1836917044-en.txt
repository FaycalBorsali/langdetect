The lyrics were written by the medician and journalist Vicente Salias in 1810. The music was later composed by musician Juan José Landaeta. It is said, however, that the melody was known since 1840 as La Marsellesa Venezolana (Venezuelan Marseillaise), in reference to its subtle similarity to the French national anthem.Some recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem is Andrés Bello, and not Salias, to whom it was originally credited, and the music composed by another musician called Lino Gallardo. However, this theory is yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.LyricsExternal links Efemérides Venezolanas, for detailed information.
