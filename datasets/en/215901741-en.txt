 Av (Hebrew: אָב, Standard Av Tiberian  ; from Akkadian abu) is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in July–August on the Gregorian calendar.In the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 29a, we read "When we enter month of Av, our joy is diminished". This is due to the fact that the darkest events in Jewish history occurred during the first week and a half of this month, particularly The Nine Days which culminate in Tisha B'Av. However, there is a minor and largely unknown holiday during the full moon of the month called Tu B'Av which was, in ancient times, one of the happiest days of the year.In 1290 &ndash; on the 9th day of Av, which is the same day that the Temple in Jerusalem was twice destroyed, and which is therefore the worst day in Jewish history &ndash; the Jews were expelled from Israel and not permitted to return for almost four centuries.The month is also sometimes referred to as Menachem Av () (Av of Comfort), but most only use this title in the sanctification of the month recited on the Shabbat before Rosh Chodesh and following Tisha B'Av.Holidays in AvAv 9 -Fast of Tisha B'Av - (fast day) (though Karaites mark the fast on the 7th and 10th) Av 15 - Tu B'AvOther usesIn the story of Xenogears, Av is the name of a country, named after the Hebrew month.
