The town's Gothic cathedral was built by him, although only the Romanesque tower is left from the original building, with its carved Renaissance portal and fine cloister dating from the 16th and 18th centuries. The 12th century castle preserves a fine keep and a very old and unusual cistern with monograms of master masons.Just outside the town, within walking distance from the back of the cathedral, is the tiny 7th century São Pedro de Balsemão Chapel, a lovely Visigothic chapel believed to be the oldest in Portugal and second oldest in Europe.ReferencesExternal linksMunicipality official websitePhotos from LamegoCategory:Cities in Portugal Category:Municipalities of Portugalca:Lamego de:Lamego es:Lamego fr:Lamego gl:Lamego, Portugal it:Lamego nl:Lamego pl:Lamego pt:Lamego ro:Lamego ru:Ламегу fi:Lamego tr:Lamego vo:Lamego
