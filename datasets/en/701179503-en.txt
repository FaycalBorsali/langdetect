cap.]]Chanoch Nissany is a motor racing driver. He was born on 29 July 1963 in Tel Aviv, Israel but is now based in Budapest in Hungary. He is a successful businessman, and initially took up motor racing as a hobby. He is Israel's first Formula One driver, and the first Jewish F1 driver since Tomas Scheckter tested for Jaguar in 2000.CareerNissany is said to have had an unconventional career. He only started racing in 2002, at the relatively late age of 38. He began his career in the 2002 Formula 2000 Hungarian National Championship, and was runner-up in his first season. Since then he has progressed, via Formula 3000, to become a Formula One test driver.Nissany was Minardi's third driver at the 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix because of the driver's popularity in Hungary. This was announced as a one-off deal, although a deal with Nissany's personal sponsor, UPEX, might have allowed him to participate as Minardi's third driver in additional grands prix.Nissany was noted for being far off the pace and spinning into a gravel trap in his grand prix Friday debut. He was subsequently replaced by the more able Enrico Toccacelo but nonetheless made his mark, if in the wrong manner, on the Grand Prix world.Racing recordComplete Formula 3000 results(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap.)YearEntrantChassisEngineTyres12345678910DCPoints2004]]Coloni]]Lola]] B02/50Judd]] KVSMR]]ESP]]MON]]EUR]]FRA]]GBR]]GER]]HUNRetBELRetITA12NC0Complete Formula One participations(key)YearEntrantChassisEngine12345678910111213141516171819WDCPoints2005]]Minardi Cosworth]]PS05]]V10]]AUS]]MAL]]BHR]]SMR]]ESP]]MON]]EUR]]CAN]]USA]]FRA]]GBR]]GER]]HUNTDTUR]]ITA]]BEL]]BRA]]JPN]]CHN]]-- Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli Jews Nissany, Chanoch Nissany, Chanoch Nissany, Chanoch Nissany, Chanoch de:Chanoch Nissany es:Janoj Nisani fr:Chanoch Nissany it:Chanoch Nissany hu:Chanoch Nissany nl:Chanoch Nissany pl:Chanoch Nissany sv:Chanoch Nissany
