The Knight Anole (Anolis equestris) is a species of lizard in the Polychrotidae family, and the largest species of anole. Other common names include Cuban Night Anole or just Cuban Anole. It is native to Cuba, but has been introduced into Miami-Dade (including Miami Beach), Broward, and Palm Beach Counties of Florida. It grows to a length of 13 to 20 inches (33 to 51 cm) including the tail. It is fiercely territorial. Aggressive to anything that enters its territory, the Knight Anole will face almost any intruder it perceives to be a threat (from a distance). During its display, a lizard will sit high on all fours, gape menacingly, turn green, and perhaps bob its head. Males will extend their dewlap (a reddish-white flap underneath their chin), and both females and males will "puff themselves up" with air.In captivity, the anole's aggressiveness seems to lessen to a certain degree. In communal terraria with other species of lizards it rarely attacks smaller lizards unless it is hungry. It may be hand-fed with caution, since it has a strong bite and many small, sharp teeth. Its main habitat is shady tree trunks, for these lizards are aboreal tree dwellers. The Knight Anole is a diurnal predator, though by warming itself on asphalt, rocks, or sidewalks at the end of the day it may be able to remain active for a while into the night. Its diet as a young anole consists mainly of insects. As an adult it eats larger prey like tarantulas, other anoles, geckos, even baby birds and baby mice.
