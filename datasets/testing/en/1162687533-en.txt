The Common Mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus) is a species of aquatic salamander found throughout the northeastern United States, and parts of Canada. Mudpuppies prefer shallow water with many places to hide, but have been found at depths of up to 90 feet. The mating season is late autumn, however eggs are not laid until late spring when 50 to 100 eggs are deposited in a nest cavity under a rock or other object. It takes 1 to 2 months for the eggs to hatch and 4 to 6 years for the young to reach maturity. Mudpuppies may live for up to 20 years. The common mudpuppy is nocturnal, but can be active in the day in muddy or weed-choked waters. It is carnivorous and feeds on fish, fish eggs, crayfish, insects, and molluscs.They may be found hiding under rocks in river habitats.See alsoAxolotlOlmReferences Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is of least concernCategory:Salamanders Category:Amphibians of Michigande:Gefleckter Furchenmolch es:Necturus maculosus fr:Necture tacheté he:נקטורוס מצוי hu:Foltos barázdásgőte nl:Gevlekte salamander pl:Odmieniec amerykański pt:Necturus maculosus
