 The order Afrosoricida (a Latin-Greek compound name which means "looking like African shrews") contains the golden moles of southern Africa and the tenrecs of Madagascar and Africa, two families of small mammals that have traditionally been considered to be a part of the order Insectivora.Some biologists use Tenrecomorpha as the name for the tenrec-golden mole clade, but prevailing evidence suggests Afrosoricida is more appropriate and Tenrecomorpha is used here as the name of the tenrec suborder.Traditionally, these two families were grouped with the hedgehogs, shrews and moles in the Lipotyphla. However, there have always been minority opinions suggesting that Tenrecomorpha, or at least the golden moles, are not true lipotyphlans. These opinions are now supported by many genetic studies suggesting an association between Tenrecomorpha and various other African mammals in a proposed superorder known as Afrotheria; however there is no strong morphological evidence to link the Afrosoricida together with other Afrotherians. The Afrosoricida are sometimes considered part of the Afroinsectiphilia, a clade within the Afrotheria.INFRACLASS EUTHERIA: placental mammalsSuperorder Afrotheria (?)Clade AfroinsectiphiliaOrder AfrosoricidaSuborder TenrecomorphaFamily Tenrecidae: tenrecs and otter shrews; 30 species in 10 generaSuborder ChrysochlorideaFamily Chrysochloridae: golden moles; about 21 species in 9 generaOrder Macroscelidea: elephant shrewsOrder Tubulidentata: AardvarkClade PaenungulataOrder Hyracoidea: hyraxesOrder Proboscidea: elephantsOrder Sirenia: manatees and dugongs(Other superorders, not listed here)ReferencesSee alsoPseudoungulata Category:Afrosoricidansca:Afrosorícid cs:Afrosoricida de:Tenrekartige es:Afrosoricida fr:Afrosoricida it:Afrosoricida lt:Afrikos kirstukai li:Tenrekechtege hu:Afrosoricida nl:Tenreks en goudmollen ja:アフリカトガリネズミ目 pl:Afrosoricida pt:Afrosoricida ru:Тенрекообразные sk:Afrosoricida sl:Afrosoricida sv:Afrosoricida zh:非洲蝟目
