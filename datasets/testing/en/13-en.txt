In four-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the steriruncic tesseractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 4-space.


== Alternate names ==
Prismatorhombated demitesseractic tetracomb (pirhatit)
Great prismatodemitesseractic tetracomb


== Related honeycombs ==
The [4,3,31,1], , Coxeter group generates 31 permutations of uniform tessellations, 23 with distinct symmetry and 4 with distinct geometry. There are two alternated forms: the alternations (19) and (24) have the same geometry as the 16-cell honeycomb and snub 24-cell honeycomb respectively.
