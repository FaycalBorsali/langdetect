 Augsburg is a district in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the city of Augsburg and the districts of Aichach-Friedberg, Landsberg, Ostallgäu, Unterallgäu, Günzburg, Dillingen and Donau-Ries. The city of Augsburg is not part of the district, but nonetheless is its administrative seat.HistoryIn Roman times the Via Claudia connected the city of Augsburg and Italy. In 233 the Alamanni broke through the Limes, and the Roman rule over Swabia was ended. During the time of the Holy Roman Empire Augsburg was a bishopric principality. The city and the adjoining regions became subordinate to Bavaria after the Napoleonic Wars.The district of Augsburg was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Augsburg and Schwabmünchen and parts of other adjoining districts.GeographyThe district comprises a large area west of the city of Augsburg. 90 % are located in the nature park Augsburg-Western Forests, which is a hilly region covered with forests. It is sparsely populated and crisscrossed by brooks, flowing either eastwards to the Lech or northwards to the Danube. The Lech forms the eastern border of the district.The six cities (see below) are all situated in the easternmost part of the district, mainly in the vicinity of Augsburg. The western forest region consists of small villages.Coat of armsThe coat of arms displays:top: the red and white colours of Augsburgbottom left: the cross from the arms of the former district of Schwabmünchenbottom right: the family arms of the FuggerTowns and municipalitiesTownsMarket townsMunicipalitiesExternal linksOfficial website (German)Augsburg/Western Forests Nature Park (German)  Category:Districts of Bavariabar:Landkreis Augschburg da:Landkreis Augsburg de:Landkreis Augsburg es:Distrito de Augsburg eo:Distrikto Augsburg fr:Arrondissement d'Augsbourg id:Augsburg (distrik) it:Circondario di Augusta nl:Augsburg (district) pl:Powiat Augsburg pt:Augsburg (distrito) ro:Augsburg (district) ru:Аугсбург (район) zh:奥格斯堡县
