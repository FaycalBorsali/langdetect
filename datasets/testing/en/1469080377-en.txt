James of Bourbon-La Marche (1319 &ndash; April 6, 1362) was the son of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon and Mary of Avesnes. He was Count of Ponthieu from 1351 to 1360, and Count of La Marche from 1356 to his death.In 1335, he married Jeanne of Chatillon, daughter of Hugh of Chatillon, Lord of Leuze, and had issue:Isabelle (1340&ndash;1371), married in Lyon in 1362 Louis II, Viscount of Beaumont-au-Maine, married in 1364 Bouchard VII, Count of VendômePeter II, Count of La Marche (1342&ndash;1362)John I, Count of La Marche (1344&ndash;1393)James of Bourbon-La Marche, Baron of Argies (1346&ndash;1417), married c. 1385 Marguerite, Lady of Preaux and had issue.In 1349, he was created Captain-General of Languedoc, and in 1354, Constable of France. Weary of political intrigues, he resigned the constableship in May of 1356, but fought at the Battle of Poitiers that year. He was taken prisoner by the English, and was released by the Treaty of Brétigny. The same treaty surrendered Ponthieu to the English; but he had succeeded his brother Peter in La Marche after the latter's death at Poitiers.Moreover, the peace promised by the treaty proved illusory. While the English were at peace with France, the discharged mercenary companies found new employment by ravaging the countryside and holding whole cities to ransom. Soon after his return from captivity, King John commissioned James to raise an army to put down the "Free Companies". He did so; but he was sharply defeated at the Battle of Brignais, and both he and his oldest son were mortally wounded.
