   Vetranio (d. c. 360), born in the province of Moesia in a part of the region located in modern Serbia, is sometimes but apparently incorrectly referred to as Vetriano. He was an experienced soldier and officer when he was asked by Constantina, the sister of Roman Emperor Constantius II, to proclaim himself Caesar (March 1, 350). Her brother Constans had been killed by Magnentius earlier that year and she probably thought Vetranio could protect her family and herself against the usurper. Constantius first seemed to accept the new Caesar but later stripped him of the purple (December 25, 350). Vetranio was allowed to live the remainder of his years as a private citizen on a state pension. He is thought to have committed suicide around the year 360.External links[http://www.roman-emperors.org/vetran.htm , "Vetranio (350 A.D.)", in DIR (1996).]Vetranio coinageCategory:Year of birth unknown Category:360 deaths Category:4th century Roman usurpers Category:Constantinian dynastybg:Ветранион de:Vetranio es:Vetranio fr:Vetranio it:Vetranione nl:Vetranio pl:Vetranio sr:Ветранион tl:Vetranio tr:Vetranio
