 The word Niagara (Iroquois Nation pronunciation "Nee-ah-GAh-rah"&lt;/ref&gt;) comes from the [[Iroquois]] word ''onghiar'', meaning &quot;Across the Neck&quot; or &quot;The Strait&quot; but is popularly translated as  &quot;Thundering of Waters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was their name for the waterfall at the point where the other [[Great Lakes]] empty into [[Lake Ontario]]. It was later adapted by European settlers as [[Niagara Falls]].Niagara may refer to:GeographyNiagara River, part of the border between the United States and CanadaNiagara Escarpment, the cliff over which the Niagara River forms the fallsNiagara Peninsula, between Lakes Ontario and ErieIn the United StatesNiagara County, New YorkNiagara, New York, a townNiagara, North Dakota, a townNiagara, Wisconsin, a cityNiagara (town), WisconsinFort Niagara, near Youngstown, New YorkIn CanadaNiagara-on-the-Lake, OntarioRegional Municipality of Niagara, OntarioShipsHMS Niagara, a Royal Navy brig captured and renamed the [[USS Linnet (1814)|USS Linnet (1814)]][[USS Niagara|USS Niagara]], several ships in the U.S. Navy[[RMS Niagara|RMS Niagara]], a New Zealand civilian liner''Niagara'' (palace steamer), a steamboat that sank on the Great Lakes in 1856Entertainment''Niagara'' (1953 film)Niagara (artist), an American singer and artistNiagara (board game), a Spiel des Jahres award-winning board gameNiagara (band), a French rock bandOther usesNiagara (grape)Niagara Herald Extraordinary, one of the officers of arms at the Canadian Heraldic AuthorityNiagara University in Niagara County, New YorkNiagara College in Niagara Region, OntarioUltraSPARC T1, a microprocessor codenamed Niagara.UltraSPARC T2, a microprocessor codenamed Niagara II.ReferencesSee alsoNiagara Falls (disambiguation)ca:Niàgara de:Niagara et:Niagara es:Niágara fr:Niagara gl:Niágara ko:나이아가라 it:Niagara he:ניאגרה lt:Niagara nl:Niagara ja:ナイアガラ pl:Niagara pt:Niágara ro:Niagara ru:Ниагара (значения) sk:Niagara (rozlišovacia stránka) fi:Niagara vo:Niagara
