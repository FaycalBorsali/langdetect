DICT is a dictionary network protocol created by the DICT Development Group. It is described by RFC 2229. Its goal is to surpass the Webster protocol and to allow clients to access more dictionaries during use. Dict servers and clients use TCP port 2628.Free dictionaries available in the DICT format:Free On-line Dictionary of ComputingV.E.R.A. — Virtual Entity of Relevant Acronyms which are used in the field of computingFREELANG DictionaryHitchcock's Bible Names DictionaryWordNetJargon FileThe Devil's Dictionary (1911)Elements databaseThe U.S. Gazetteer (1990 Census)Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913)CIA World FactbookEaston's Bible Dictionary (1897)Moby Thesaurusthe freedict bilingual dictionariesCombined, they make up the Free Internet Lexicon and Encyclopedia.DICT servers:dictd (the standard server made by the DICT Development Group)DICT clients:Kdict, comes with KDEgnome-dictionary, comes with GNOMEdictem, for the Emacs text editordict.org's own dict clientOmniDictionary, for Mac OS XDictionary, an application included with Mac OS X.

For example, S60Dict is a dictionary program for Symbian Series 60 that uses DICT dictionaries.See alsoCategory:DICT clientsExternal linksdict.org DICT Development Group.
