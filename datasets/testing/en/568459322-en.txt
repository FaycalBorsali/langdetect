 Ostholstein is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southwest and clockwise) the districts of Stormarn, Segeberg and Plön, the Baltic Sea and the city of Lübeck.HistoryThe district was established in 1970 by merging the former districts of Eutin and Oldenburg. These former districts have different histories.Eutin was ruled by Lübeck. In 1803 it became an exclave of the Duchy of Oldenburg (which confusingly has nothing to do with the Holsteinian city of Oldenburg). In 1937 it was moved to Prussia and became the Prussian district of Eutin.The region of Oldenburg was a part of the duchy of Holstein. In 1864 Holstein became subordinate to Prussia, which soon afterwards established the district of Oldenburg.GeographyThe district consists of the Wagrien peninsula between the Bay of Lübeck and the Bay of Kiel, the island of Fehmarn, the eastern part of the region called "Holsteinische Schweiz" (Holsatian Switzerland) and the northern suburbs of Lübeck.Holsatian Switzerland is an area full of lakes and woody hills, which is shared with the adjoining district of Plön. The Bungsberg, though only 168 m in height, is the highest elevation in Schleswig-Holstein. The island of Fehmarn is the third largest island of Germany. Since 1963 it has been connected to the mainland by a suspension bridge.Coat of arms130px|Coat of armsThe coat of arms displays:Towns and municipalitiesIndependent townsIndependent municipalitiesÄmter1seat of the AmtExternal linksOfficial website (German)Information about the culture and landscape of Ostholstein (German) Category:Districts of Schleswig-Holsteinda:Kreis Østholsten de:Kreis Ostholstein es:Distrito de Ostholstein eo:Distrikto Orienta Holstinio fr:Arrondissement du Holstein-de-l'Est hr:Istočni Holstein (okrug) id:Ostholstein it:Ostholstein nl:Oost-Holstein no:Østholstein pl:Powiat Ostholstein pt:Ostholstein ro:Ostholstein (district) ru:Восточный Гольштейн (район) sv:Kreis Ostholstein tr:Ostholstein zh:东荷尔斯泰因县
