One building is devoted to modern arts.One painting by the Kunsthalle was involved in the Frankfurt art theft of 1994. While on loan to the Kunsthalle Schirn in Frankfurt, the painting Nebelschwaden by Caspar David Friedrich was stolen. After negotiations with the thieves, a lawyer bought back the painting; when the Kunsthalle refused to recompensate him, he sued and won.External linksKunsthalle HamburgCategory:Hamburg culture Category:Art museums and galleries in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Hamburg  de:Hamburger Kunsthalle es:Kunsthalle de Hamburgo fr:Kunsthalle de Hambourg nl:Hamburger Kunsthalle ja:ハンブルク美術館 pl:Kunsthalle w Hamburgu ru:Гамбургский Кунстхалле
