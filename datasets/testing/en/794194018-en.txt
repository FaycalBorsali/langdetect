Typha latifolia (Bulrush, Common Bulrush, Broadleaf Cattail, Common Cattail, or Cat-o'-nine-tails) is a perennial herbaceous plant in the genus Typha, which grows in temperate, subtropical and tropical areas throughout the Northern Hemisphere. It grows in marshy areas and flowers in mid to late summer.The common cattail shares its range with other related species, and hybridizes with Typha angustifolia, narrow leaf cattail, to form Typha x glauca (Typha angustifolia x T. latifolia), white cattail. Common cattail is usually found in shallower water than narrow leaf cattail.The plant is 1.5 to 3 metres high and it has two to four centimetre broad leaves.UsesThe rhizomes of Typha latifolia were eaten by many first peoples of North America, as well as the leaf bases and young flower spikes. The rhizomes can be consumed after cooking and removing the skin, while the peeled stems and leaf bases can be eaten raw or cooked.Turner, Nancy J. Food Plants of Interior First Peoples (Victoria: UBC Press, 1997) ISBN 0-7748-0606-0While Typha latifolia grows all over, including in rural areas, it is not advisable to eat specimens deriving from polluted water as it is used as a bioremediator, it absorbs pollutants. Do not eat them if they taste very bitter or spicy.YouTube - Wild Living with Sunny: episode 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Video describing collection and cooking of common cattail.The Hopi Kachinas give it to children with toys attached such as bows and dolls during the Home Dance.== External links ==USDA TYLAROOK descriptionReferencesCategory:Poales Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Estonia Category:Flora of the United Kingdomcs:Orobinec širokolistý de:Breitblättriger Rohrkolben es:Typha latifolia fr:Massette à larges feuilles fy:Grutte Tuorrebout hsb:Šěroka rohodź it:Typha latifolia lt:Plačialapis švendras nl:Grote lisdodde nds-nl:Lampepoetser nn:Breitt dunkjevle pl:Pałka szerokolistna sl:Širokolistni rogoz fi:Leveäosmankäämi sv:Bredkaveldun bat-smg:Plačialapis švendrs uk:Рогіз широколистий
