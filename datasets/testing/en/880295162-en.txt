 |Skúvoy is an island in central Faroe Islands, located to the south of Sandoy. It is named after the large number of skua present on the island (who have a habit of attacking intruders). There is only one settlement on the island: Skúvoy on the east coast. There are two mountains: Knúkur (392 m) and Heyggjurin Mikli (391 m).There are 300-400 m cliffs along the west coast, which are home to many guillemot. Egg collections take place in early June, though this occurs in the first week only so as to allow the guillemots to make another. The Black Death in the 14th century killed all the inhabitants except one woman - Rannvá. Her cottage can still be seen. Skúvoy was also the home of Sigmundur Brestisson, the hero of the Færeyinga Saga (Saga of the Faroese).  harbour]] Issued: 22 May 2000Photo: Per á Hædd]] External linkspersonal website with 9 aerial photos of Skúvoy   * Category:Islands of the Faroe Islandsca:Skúvoy cs:Skúvoy da:Skúvoy de:Skúvoy es:Skúvoy fi:Skúvoy fo:Skúvoy fr:Skúvoy he:סקובוי hu:Skúvoy is:Skúvoy nl:Skúvoy nn:Skúvoy no:Skúvoy pl:Skúvoy pt:Skúvoy sk:Skúvoy sv:Skúvoy vi:Skúvoy
