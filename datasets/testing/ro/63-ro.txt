Aceasta este o listă de recorduri meteorologice, o listă a evenimentelor de cele mai extreme fenomene meteorologice pentru diferite categorii. Mai multe recorduri meteorologice sunt masurate în condiții specifice, cum ar fi temperatura de suprafață și viteza vântului, pentru a menține coerența între măsurătorile din jurul Pamântului. Fiecare dintre aceste recorduri este considerat a fi valoarea-record oficial observat, ca aceste înregistrări ar fi putut fi depășite înainte de instrumentație meteo modern a fost inventat, sau în zone îndepărtate, fără o stație meteo oficial.


== Temperatură ==
Condiții standard de măsurare de temperatura sunt de 1,2 metri deasupra solului, și nu în lumina directă a soarelui (de aici termenul de, grade x "in umbra")

*Temperature reached on multiple occasions; this is the most recent.
†There are a few reports of temperatures higher than this during phenomena known as heat bursts, including a report of 87 °C (188 °F) in Abadan, Iran in June 1967. There are also reports made by satellite analysis, including one of 66.8 °C (152.2 °F) measured in the Flaming Mountains of China in 2008.
These temperatures have never been confirmed, and are not recognized as world records. The former highest official temperature on Earth, held for 90 years by ‘Aziziya, Libya, was de-certified by the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) in January 2012 as the record for the world's highest surface temperature (this temperature of 57.8 °C (136 °F), registered on 13 September 1922, is currently considered to have been a recorder's error.
Christopher C. Burt, the weather historian writing for Weather Underground who shepherded the Libya reading's 2012 disqualification, believes that the 1913 Death Valley reading is "a myth", and is at least four or five degrees Fahrenheit too high, as do other weather historians Dr. Arnold Court and William Taylor Reid. Burt proposes that the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth is still at Death Valley, but is instead 53.9 °C (129 °F) recorded five times: 20 July 1960, 18 July 1998, 20 July 2005, 7 July 2007, and 30 June 2013.
‡On 16 January 1889, a temperature of 53 °C (128 °F) was recorded at Cloncurry, Queensland. It was measured with a non-standard thermometer, so it is unknown if this reading was valid or not. The reading is not recognised by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

* This temperature is considered the lowest ever officially recorded in Antarctica and in the World, as it was perceived by ground-positioned thermometers in 1983. Satellite analyses made in 10 August 2010 pointed to a temperature of −93.2 °C (−135.8 °F) near Dome F in Queen Maud Land, but this record is not officially listed because it was measured by remote sensing methods that are not totally consistent, unlike the 1983 temperature. See Lowest temperature recorded on Earth for details.
† It is reported by local news outlet that temperatures in Mt. Pulag in the Philippines which is 2,922 meters above sea level plunges as low as 2 °C (35.6 °F). PAGASA cannot verify
